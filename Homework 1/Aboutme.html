I have been interested in gardening since I was a kid. My mom has a container garden where she grows flowers and some root vegetables (ginger and turmeric). Every year she makes a condiment of ginger and turmeric and between me and my sis, it doesn&rsquo;t last long.

This blog is about my experiments to grow food in an organic way. I hope to connect with people who have been gardening and learn from them.
